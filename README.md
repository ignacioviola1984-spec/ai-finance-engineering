# AI Finance Portfolio

Finance AI engineering projects: live API integration, a custom MCP
connector for a multi-entity finance system, a multi-agent month-end close
model with reliability controls, and a multi-agent CFO office that runs the
close over a shared, auditable state. Built by a finance operator with 17
years of experience, now building the systems.

> **See it run:** [`CASE-STUDY.md`](CASE-STUDY.md) walks one real month-end close
> end to end (real, code-computed output). **Work with me:** [`OFFERING.md`](OFFERING.md).

## Projects

### Finance MCP Connector (`finance-mcp/`)
A Model Context Protocol server that exposes the finance system of a
multi-entity SaaS (6 legal entities, 6 currencies) as callable tools:
consolidated P&L, balance sheet, AR aging, and cash position, with
multi-currency consolidation at period-close FX. Ships with a Python MCP
client that drives the server over the protocol, plus input validation and
a deliberately read-only surface. Details: [`finance-mcp/README.md`](finance-mcp/README.md).

**Stack:** Python, MCP (FastMCP), stdio transport, multi-entity consolidation.

### Multi-Agent Close & Reporting Model (`orchestration/`)
The AI Finance Operating Model v2: an orchestrator that coordinates
specialized sub-agents (close review, cash forecast, reporting) and adds a
reliability layer, deterministic checks between stages, a timestamped audit
trail, severity-based escalation, and a human-in-the-loop approval gate
before any figure reaches the board. Details:
[`orchestration/README.md`](orchestration/README.md).

**Stack:** Python, Anthropic API, agent patterns (chaining, routing,
sub-agents), audit trail, human-in-the-loop controls.

### CFO Office — multi-agent finance department over shared state (`cfo-office/`)
The operating model evolved into a full CFO office: **eight specialist agents**
— Controller, Treasury, Administration (Accounts Receivable / Accounts Payable /
Tax), Accounting & Reporting (the close and the three financial statements),
FP&A, Strategic Finance, Internal Controls, and an **independent Audit** — that
communicate through a shared state book (`CFOContext`), coordinated by a CFO
orchestrator. It runs the whole month-end loop — **record → close → report →
analyze → control → audit** — reconciles the agents' numbers with deterministic
cross-checks and consolidates escalations by severity without double-counting.
Governance is **two-tier (maker-checker), the way finance actually works**: each
function is signed off by its own domain expert (the Tax Manager signs tax, the
Treasurer signs treasury, …) as the first line, and the CFO gives a single
**final** consolidated sign-off — not a pseudo-review of every detail a generalist
can't own. Two of the agents are themselves sub-orchestrators (Administration,
Accounting & Reporting), giving a real two-level org. The books reconcile, the three financial statements
articulate, and the Audit agent re-derives the figures independently and issues
an opinion. Details: [`cfo-office/README.md`](cfo-office/README.md).

**Stack:** Python, Anthropic API, shared-state multi-agent coordination, two-level
orchestration, record-to-report (reconciliations + articulating financial
statements), budget-vs-actual variance, internal controls, independent audit,
cross-agent reconciliation, audit trail, **maker-checker review per function +
final CFO sign-off**.

> assessment — what's already production-grade, where the real gap is, and how it
> deploys today as a governed co-pilot: [`PRODUCTION-READINESS.md`](PRODUCTION-READINESS.md).

### Finance Document Intelligence / RAG (`document-intelligence/`)
Semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation, and structured extraction
over finance documents (vendor contracts, expense policy): embeds and
chunks the documents, answers questions with source citations, and extracts
key contract terms into a table. Includes the judgment of when RAG helps and
when full context is better. Details:
[`document-intelligence/README.md`](document-intelligence/README.md).

**Stack:** Python, sentence-transformers / PyTorch, embeddings & cosine
similarity, RAG, structured extraction, Anthropic API.

### Evals, Guardrails & Reliability (`evals/`)
An evaluation harness that measures whether the agents are trustworthy:
regression on consolidated numbers, accuracy of contract extraction against a
known ground truth, and a grounding guardrail that checks the RAG refuses
out-of-scope questions instead of inventing. Exits non-zero on failure, so it
works as a regression test. Details: [`evals/README.md`](evals/README.md).

**Stack:** Python, evaluation harness, regression testing, grounding
guardrails. This is the reliability layer over the other projects.

### Web App / Live Demo (`webapp/`)
A Streamlit app that puts a usable interface over three of the projects so a
non-technical person can operate them: the FX agent, the operating model
(with the human-in-the-loop approval as a button), and document intelligence
(RAG + extraction). Run with `streamlit run app.py`. Details:
[`webapp/README.md`](webapp/README.md).

**Stack:** Python, Streamlit, reuses the project code via imports.

### API Integration (`api-integration/`)
Connecting finance workflows to live external data: a direct FX API client,
a multi-currency rates and conversion tool against official ECB data, and a
natural-language agent that calls an FX API as a tool. Details:
[`api-integration/README.md`](api-integration/README.md).

**Stack:** Python, `requests`, REST/JSON, Anthropic tool use, error handling.

## Diagrams (`diagrams/`)
Architecture diagrams for the agent tool-use flow, the MCP protocol, the
SDK's role, and the operating model. Index: [`diagrams/README.md`](diagrams/README.md).

## Design principle

In finance the number has to be right. Across every project, figures are
computed deterministically in code; the model routes, reasons, and writes
prose, but never produces a number on its own. Controls and a human approve
at the critical points.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `pip install requests anthropic python-dotenv mcp`
- An Anthropic API key in a local `.env` as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (never committed)

## About

17 years in senior finance, now building AI systems for finance operations.
These projects run on synthetic data modeled on a multi-entity SaaS; the
architecture and accounting logic are built to point at production data.
